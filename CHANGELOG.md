# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- When `EdfSignal.physical_min` or `EdfSignal.physical_max` do not fit into their header fields, they are now always rounded down or up, respectively, to ensure all physical values lie within the physical range ([#2](https://github.com/the-siesta-group/edfio/pull/2)).
- Support non-standard header fields (not encoded as UTF-8) by replacing incompatible characters with "ï¿½" ([#4](https://github.com/the-siesta-group/edfio/pull/4)).


## [0.1.0] - 2023-11-09
